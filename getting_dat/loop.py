# my small, poorly named function that calls mobs from moveobsfun and performs most of the simulating of the data. 
# dxyz represents adder from moveobsfunâ€” that is, how much distance is being added onto the original coordinate for the observatory 
# stit is just an array of strings to help with naming the simulated pulsar data that comes out the other end as 13 text files (one for each adder)
# The loop does several things. First it calls mobs which moves the observatory. Then, it runs TEMPO2 which takes in the .par and .tim files for
# the desired pulsar and produces the new .par file withe the predicted measurements. It will be different than the input .par file because the observatoy
# position has changed. That being said, not much change happens at small differences in position. 
# It renames the .par file with my naming system and then replaces the observatory file (which now has altred coordinates) with the original. 
# This process is then repeated for each adder. 
# This was the program that was ran with SLURM on bowser, some pulsars taking a few seconds and others taking days depending on how many TOAs (time of arrivals)
# were in the .tim file. For example, pulsars that have been observed a lot took the most time
